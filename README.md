# CS-5500-Playlist-Generator

# We're building a system that lets the user describe their mood and automatically generates a playlist from their own library.  It'll match the energy, tempo, and overall feel theyâ€™re going for, make sure the songs flow nicely together, and get smarter over time based on what they skip or like all from their Spotify account.
